You are now ready to begin your final project. Before you get started, make sure youâ€™ve completed or are familiar with the following:
- Created a conda environment with the buildings_bench module installed
- Comfortable with OOP, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and NN model architectures

For the final project, there are three tasks that need to be completed. The first task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the designated dataset(s). Next, you will train a model on the selected dataset. Finally, using the generated metrics, determine which dataset performs best and complete the tasks outlined below.

There are three notebooks in this directory that must be completed in the following sequence to finish the project:
- EDA-Dataset.ipynb
- Train-Model.ipynb
- Post-Data-Analysis.ipynb

Since this is a group project, all members will complete the same set of tasks, but each team member will work with a different dataset. To avoid overlap, each person should choose one of the five available members (Member-ideal, Member-electricity, Member-lcl, Member-sceaux, or Member-borealis). If you select Member-ideal, you will use the Ideal dataset; similarly, Member-lcl will use the LCL dataset, and so on.  Make sure no two members select the same dataset.
