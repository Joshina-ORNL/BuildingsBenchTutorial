You are now ready to begin your final project. Before you get started, ensure you have completed or are familiar with the following:
- Created a `conda` environment with the buildings_bench module installed
- Comfortable with `OOP`, `PyTorch`, `Matplotlib`, and `NN` model architectures

There are four assignments in this directory that must be completed in the following sequence to finish the project:
- `Explore-Dataset.ipynb`
- `Train-Model.ipynb`
- `Select-Model.ipynb`
- `Best-Overall-Model.md` (Group Assignment)

The first three assignments must be completed individually, while the Best-Overall-Model.md will be a group task. These individual tasks are essential for completing the group assignment. The first task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the designated dataset(s), followed by training a model on the selected dataset. Finally, you will evaluate the models using the generated metrics to determine which one performs best.

For the group project, all team members will complete the same set of tasks. However, to avoid redundancy, each member will work with a different dataset. Before moving forward, gather as a team and decide which dataset each member will choose. Each team member should select one of the five available datasets, which are:

- `Member-ideal`: `Ideal` dataset
- `Member-electricity`: `Electricity` dataset
- `Member-lcl`: `LCL` dataset
- `Member-sceaux`: `Sceaux` dataset
- `Member-borealis`: `Borealis` dataset

Make sure that no two members select the same dataset.

Below is a brief description of all the datasets, which we have taken from the publication BuildingsBench: A Large-Scale Dataset of 900K Buildings and Benchmark for Short-Term Load Forecasting (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00142). For more detailed information, please refer to the paper and its references.

__Electricity__: 370 commercial buildings in Portugal.

__Low Carbon London (lcl)__ : Energy consumption meter readings from 5,567 London, UK house-holds.

__IDEAL__: Electricity meter data from 255 homes in Edinburgh, UK.

__Sceaux__: Energy consumption from a single household in Sceaux, Paris.

__Borealis__: 6-second load measurements recorded for 30 homes in Waterloo, ON.
