Congratulations! You’re almost done with the project. This final part must be completed as a group, so if you’ve finished early, please wait for your team members to complete their tasks.

I recommend including this component as a "Final Results" section in your presentation. 

### Best Model Combinations per Dataset

Please fill out this table with best model you have selected for your assigned dataset. 

```
| Dataset     | Model  | Activation Function | Optimizer | Epochs | R² Score | MAE | MSE | Training Time  |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|-----|----------------|
| ideal       |        |                     |           |        |          |     |     |                |
| electricity |        |                     |           |        |          |     |     |                |

1) Do you notice any common patterns among the models in terms of architecture, optimizer, activation function, or training time?
2) Can you try training the best-performing model configuration (based on the table above) on a dataset that hasn’t been tested yet, and compare its performance to the current best model?
