### Intro-Modules

Within Intro-Modules, `you must first complete the Develop-Conda-Kernel.ipynb notebook and create a kernel, as this is required to run any of the remaining tutorials. After that`, if you're already familiar with `object-oriented programming` and `PyTorch`, you may complete the tutorials in any order. However, the recommended sequence is:

- Develop-Conda-Kernel.ipynb
- Intro-Object-Oriented-Programming.ipynb
- Visualize-Time-Series-Data.ipynb
- Intro-PyTorch.ipynb
- Intro-NN.ipynb

__Develop-Conda-Kernel Tutorial:__ One of the initial technical tasks in developing deep learning models is setting up a dedicated Conda environment. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Conda environment and convert it into a Conda kernel that can be used to run other tutorials on NERSC JupyterHub. __Do not skip__ this step, as the kernel is required to run the subsequent tutorials.

__Intro-Object-Oriented-Programming:__ Object-Oriented Programming is foundational for writing modular and scalable machine learning code. In this tutorial, you’ll explore its core fundamentals through practical examples.

__Intro-PyTorch:__ In my opinion, PyTorch is the most widely used deep learning library today, and proficiency with it is essential—even for entry-level machine learning roles. While it’s not feasible to cover all of PyTorch’s capabilities in a single tutorial, this session will introduce you to one of its core components: the tensor, a fundamental data structure in deep learning.

__Intro-NN:__ One of the most critical components in machine learning development is selecting the optimal model architecture and identifying the right features to build an effective and efficient model. In this tutorial, you will gain hands-on experience experimenting with model architectures, various optimizers, loss functions, and training epochs to determine the most effective configuration.  

__Visualize-Time-Series-Data__: In this tutorial, you will visualize time-series data to explore trends across holidays, buildings, and months. This type of analysis is a common practice, as it helps familiarize you with the data and supports informed decision-making during model development.
