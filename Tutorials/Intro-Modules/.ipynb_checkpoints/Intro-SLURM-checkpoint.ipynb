    "# SLURM 101\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this exercise are as follows:\n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with batch scripts.\n",
    "- Understand how to modify and submit an existing batch script.\n",
    "- Learn how to run a job using Slurm.\n",
    "- Explore job layout on a node and understand how to query the queue for your job’s status and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perlmutter uses SchedMD's Slurm Workload Manager for job scheduling and management. Slurm provides functionality similar to other schedulers such as IBM’s LSF but offers unique control over Perlmutter’s resources through custom commands and options. Slurm documentation for each command is available via the man utility and online at: https://slurm.schedmd.com/man_index.html. Additional documentation can be found at: https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common Slurm commands are summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Command     | Action/Task\n",
    "------------|------------------------------\n",
    "squeue      | Show the current job queue\n",
    "sbatch      | Submit a batch script\n",
    "srun        | Launch a parallel job\n",
    "sacct       | View accounting information for jobs or job steps\n",
    "scancel     | Cancel a job or job step\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to interact with the batch system is via batch scripts. A batch script is simply a shell script with added directives to request various resources from, or provide specific information to, the scheduling system. Aside from these directives, the batch script consists of the series of commands needed to set up and run your job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example batch script, submit.sl looks like this:\n",
