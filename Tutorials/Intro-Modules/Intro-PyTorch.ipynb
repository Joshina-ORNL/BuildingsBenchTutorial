    "In my opinion, PyTorch is one of the most, if not the most, sought-after skills in today’s market. Proficiency in this library significantly increases your chances of securing a job or internship, even in the current job market. From job openings at tech companies like NVIDIA and Meta to national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, PyTorch is frequently listed as a required skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library itself is extensive, and I believe a one-week bootcamp may not be sufficient to cover it in depth. Therefore, it’s not feasible to address every aspect of PyTorch in this short tutorial. However, this tutorial aims to introduce you to PyTorch tensors, the fundamental data structure used in deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explore the characteristics and operations of tensors, along with commonly used methods for tensor manipulation. This includes understanding tensor shape, dimensionality, accessing individual elements, performing mathematical operations, and reshaping tensors. The tutorial introduces foundational yet widely applicable tasks that are commonly used in both model training and code debugging."
